# Seasonal Trends in Movie Viewership and Movie Genres

I am  Hilal Öngel. I am a Sophomore Computer Science student from Sabancı University, and this is my DSA210 term project. The aim of this project is to analyze the relationship between seasons, the number of moviegoers, and the popularity of different movie genres in Turkey. Project Proposal: Seasonal Trends in Movie Viewership and Movie Genres

## 1.	Motivation

The film industry experiences fluctuations in moviegoer attendance throughout the year. Understanding how seasonal trends affect movie preferences and viewership can provide valuable insights for movie studios, distributors, and marketers. This project aims to analyze the relationship between seasons, the number of moviegoers, and the popularity of different movie genres in Turkey.

##  2.	Data Sources

• Box Office Turkey (https://boxofficeturkiye.com/)
o Weekly and yearly moviegoer data
o Number of viewers per film

• IMDb (https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro)
o Movie genre classification


## 3.	Data Collection and Preprocessing
   
• Extract moviegoer data and the number of viewers from Box Office Turkey.
• Fetch movie from IMDb.
• Categorize data into four seasons:




## 4.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
• Viewership Trends: Identify seasonal fluctuations in the number of moviegoers.
• Genre Popularity: Determine which genres perform better in different seasons.
• City-Based Analysis: Analyze how trends vary across major Turkish cities.

##  5.	Hypothesis Testing and Statistical Analysis
   
**• Hypothesis 1:** The number of moviegoers differs significantly across seasons, with higher attendance in the summer and lower attendance in the winter.

**• Hypothesis 2:** Certain movie genres (e.g., action, comedy) are more popular during specific seasons (e.g., summer for action movies, winter for family-friendly movies).

**• Hypothesis 3:** There is a positive correlation between warmer weather and higher movie attendance, especially during the summer season.

### Correlation Analysis: Measure the relationship between seasons and movie genres.
• ANOVA Testing: Assess if seasonal differences in viewership are statistically significant.
• Regression Models: Predict viewership trends based on seasonal data.

## 6.	Data Visualization
• Time Series Plots: Show viewership trends across seasons.
• Bar Charts: Compare the popularity of different genres by season.
• Heatmaps: Display correlations between seasons, viewership, and genres.

## 7.	Machine Learning Application
• Classification Models: Predict movie success based on seasonal factors.
• Clustering Analysis: Identify hidden patterns in moviegoer preferences.
